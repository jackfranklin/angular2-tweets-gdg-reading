# Angular 2 Demo: GDG Reading DevFest


## Running

```
$ npm install
```

You need to run two processes separately. The first will compile your TypeScript:

```
$ npm run tsc
```

To run the app locally with live reload enabled, use `npm start`:

```
$ npm start
```

This will run the app on port 8080 and open a new browser tab.
